## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
With the help of this challange, I learnt how to make use of the Responsive rules (Media query) in CSS and some 
HTML codes
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media screen and (max-width: 669px) {
    .container{
        padding: 30px 30px 40px 30px;
        margin: 50px 40px 40px 80px;
    }
  }
}

### Continued development
I'll love to contine with JavaScript to enhance my design and add responsiveness to it.
